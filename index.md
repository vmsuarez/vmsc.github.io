#### About Me
Welcome! My name is Víkko and I am a current Ph.D. in the lab of Dr. Stephen Van Hooser at Brandeis University. This website is dedicated to track my academic journey as I navigate my budding career as a scientist and mentor. I am hoping that this open, transparent *stream of consciousness* helps other fellow first-generation and immigrant scientist find solidarity.
