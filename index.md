# Víkko (Víctor) Manuel Suárez Casanova, M.S.
##  3rd Year Neuroscience Ph.D. @ Brandeis University

### About Me
Welcome! My name is Víkko and I am a current Ph.D. in the lab of Dr. Stephen Van Hooser at Brandeis University. This website is dedicated to track my academic journey as I navigate my budding career as a scientist and mentor. I am hoping that this open, transparent *stream of consciousness* helps other fellow first-generation and immigrant scientist find solidarity. 

#### Biography
Víctor Manuel Suárez Casanova is a second year Ph.D. student in the Neuroscience program at Brandeis University, whose research is focused on understanding visual system, specifically how the primary visual cortex (V1) is able to encode information about the speed, direction, orientation, and spatiotemporal of a given stimuli using the ferret model organism. Before transitioning to a systems neuroscience lab, Víkko was an M.S./M.B.A. candidate in Biotechology and Healthcare Management while in the lab of Dr. Gina G. Turrigiano under the supervision of Dr. Raul A. Ramos. Originally from Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia, Víkko immigrated to the United States to pursue an overall better quality of life and education. He completed his Bachelor's of Science degree in Science & Technology under the Molecular Biology track with minors in both Mathematical Sciences and Chemistry. During his undergraduate career, he held a multitude of leadership positions such as president of the Beta Beta Beta Biogical Honor Society and Head Tutor of the Kean University ACCESS program. Víkko aims to build a career where he can contribute to scientific discovery while continuing to advocate for fellow immigrant and first-gen students to pursue careers in science. 

His passion for biology started at his alma mater, Vassar College, where he earned a Bachelor’s of Arts Degree in Biology, while also being a greenhouse, ecological preserve, and laboratory assistant. Tré aims to use his training to build a career in which he can continue researching the epigenetic basis to various human diseases. Additionally, he strives to elevate scientific accessibility and inclusion by encouraging more people from underrepresented groups to pursue scientific careers and by providing them with advice, mentorship, and resources.
